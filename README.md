## MY WHATBYTES ASSIGNMENT/TASK

Key Features and Technologies Used
* react-chartjs-2:
Utilized this library to implement dynamic and visually appealing charts, including a doughnut chart for percentile comparisons and a line chart for performance analysis.

* Tailwind CSS:
Used for styling the navbar and sidebar due to its utility-first CSS approach, allowing for rapid and responsive design.

* SCSS:
Preferred for styling the home page, given its flexibility, maintainability, and suitability for handling a larger volume of code.

* react-icons:
Incorporated for the icons used across the UI for better visual representation.

* next/font:
Used to automatically optimize and load font families dynamically based on project needs.

* next/image:
Utilized for optimizing images throughout the application. This ensures responsive images and lazy loading, which improves performance and user experience.

* Responsive Design:
Ensured that the layout adapts seamlessly across devices. On smaller screens, sections like "Skill-wise" and "Question Analysis" move to the bottom as required.

* Maintained code modularity and organization for better scalability.

* Ensured TypeScript typing was implemented wherever possible to enhance code quality.
